    <p>I'm Mallow, established Orca enthusiast and creator of many things. This is my little spot on the internet, a place to organize my projects, showcase my work, and maybe write some stuff about things.<p/>

<p>I've never had social media, it's always felt too loud and reactionary to feel at all comforting. Sure you might see some cool art or something, but it always feels like you're missing out on something, and that's nothing to say of the influence corporations have on what we see, or what they want us to think. It feels like a churning river rapid, one that consumes attention, trust, and hope, and I just want to move inland and set up a house on stable ground.<p/>

<p>A website gives me the opportunity to elaborate on my work in detail, more than a short quip can. I have a lot to say, sometimes, admittedly, a bit too much. But I hope that enthusiasm is appreciated by someone! </p>
